                        <li>
                            <h3>1. Know why you want to code</h3>
                            <p>As with any journey, you need to know your why before taking a plunge into coding. Having some fun, stimulating your mind, gaining an edge at work, or even starting a career in software engineering — your reason could be anything. What matters is that you’re crystal clear on what it is. If you can figure that out, you’ll have a powerful purpose to fall back on when the next time motivation goes down. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>2. Define your coding goal</h3>
                            <p>Just like knowing your why is the first step of any journey, defining your one big goal is the first step towards achieving it. The key here is to make it as specific as you can. For example, learning how to create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the next four weeks. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>3. Have a clear plan</h3>
                            <p>Your coding journey doesn’t differ from that of any other beginner. You need a clear plan if you want to reach the destination. For instance, knowing which programming languages to learn isn’t enough. You also need to know which specific aspects to learn and when to learn them.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>4. Break down goals</h3>
                            <p>With goals, you need to keep two perspectives in mind. The long term and the short term. Your long-term goal could be to learn website coding over the next four weeks. While that long-term goal will motivate you initially, you need to aim for smaller wins to keep your spirits up in the long run. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>5. Keep coding fun</h3>
                            <p>Don’t let your passion for coding turn into a resentful practice. If you get stuck somewhere or just feel like you’re in a rut, take a step back and mix things up. If a JavaScript exercise is puzzling you nonstop, try creating some memes with HTML and CSS instead. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>6. Keep track of your success</h3>
                            <p>Keeping track of your success and celebrating small wins is just as important as making progress. The good news is that by breaking down your goals, you’ve already set yourself up for tracking your success. Now you just need to take a moment every now and then to sit back and reflect on your achievements so far. You’ll get an instant boost of motivation every time you’ll do this. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>7. Code something you want to share</h3>
                            <p>Learning arbitrary coding concepts can get boring after some time. To keep your motivation up, think of all the things you’ve always wanted to create. Then use your newfound coding skills to make them happen. Just don’t forget to start with the simplest version possible. You can then work your way up from there. </p>
